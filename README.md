Compute widht of text in pixels given a string, font family and size.

Small javascript function that allows you to compute the exact width of a text in pixels.
You can specify the font family and size or let it detect the default defined document style and use that.

It's tiny, one function and stack overflow nor ChatGPT generated something useful for me so I rick-rolled my own as a proof
of concept.
Initially I tried canvas2d but that is a rabbit hole because of scaling mismatches.

All js code and html with 2 tests is included in the index.html file.
